# xlsx2format

This is an app I made for my mom that would help streamline some of her workflow. Mom, you probably won't see this, but I love you!!!

It is built entirely out of python 3 with tkinter and panda being the only two big modules imported,
with xlrd and csv imported so that the program is able to read and write the required files.

It is in the format to store bank statements in Mexico, I think.

How it works:
1. Import an excel file that follows format for input
2. Choose output file type (csv/txt)
3. File appears in file directory where original file was
