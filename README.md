# xlsx2format

This is an app I made for my mom that would help streamline some of her workflow. You probably won't see this, but I love ya!!!

It is built entirely out of python 3 with tkinter and panda being the only two manin imports,
with xlrd and csv as helping tools to be able to read and write the required files.

How it works:
1. Import an excel file that follows format for input (kinda hard to describe the details)
2. Choose output file type
3. File appears in file directory where original file was
